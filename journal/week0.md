# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
![cruddur](https://github.com/lorenzopoulet/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/assets/141220777/d282f4ec-fe88-4bf6-99be-59ff65eea383)

This is the starting week of the AWS cloud bootcamp challenge. This first week has started with a description of Billing and Architecture and how to think and design a [proper architecture](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/c4ed2918-2011-42a3-a27a-ed1a4b4877ab/edit?viewport_loc=-878%2C-395%2C3012%2C1479%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_6732949d-2b6f-42ae-a572-67b615c1e564).

### Creating CLI credentials and Billing Alarm 

- We are going to install the AWS CLI when our Gitpod enviroment lanuches.
- The bash commands we are using are the same as the [AWS CLI Install Instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

Update our `.gitpod.yml` file to include the following task.

```sh
tasks:
  - name: aws-cli
    env:
      AWS_CLI_AUTO_PROMPT: on-partial
    init: |
      cd /workspace
      curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
      unzip awscliv2.zip
      sudo ./aws/install
      cd $THEIA_WORKSPACE_ROOT
```

### Create a new User and Generate AWS Credentials

- Go to (IAM Users Console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?region=us-east-1#/users) andrew create a new user
- `Enable console access` for the user
- Create a new `Admin` Group and apply `AdministratorAccess`
- Create the user and go find and click into the user
- Click on `Security Credentials` and `Create Access Key`
- Choose AWS CLI Access
- Download the CSV with the credentials

### Set Env Vars

This will ensure that the credentials will be registered inside environment variables. To do so, we need to use the `export` command to save them into these variables.
```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```
Here is the same for gitpod.
```
gp env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
gp env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
gp env AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

### Check that the AWS CLI is working and you are the expected user

```sh
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

You should see something like this:
```json
{
    "UserId": "AIFBZRJIQN2ONP4ET4EK4",
    "Account": "655602346534",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::655602346534:user/andrewcloudcamp"
}
```

## Enable Billing 

We need to turn on Billing Alerts to recieve alerts...


- In your Root Account go to the [Billing Page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/)
- Under `Billing Preferences` Choose `Receive Billing Alerts`
- Save Preferences


## Creating a Billing Alarm

### Create an AWS Budget

[aws budgets create-budget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/budgets/create-budget.html)

Get your AWS Account ID
```sh
aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text
```

- Supply your AWS Account ID
- Update the json files
- This is another case with AWS CLI its just much easier to json files due to lots of nested json

```sh
aws budgets create-budget \
    --account-id AccountID \
    --budget file://aws/json/budget.json \
    --notifications-with-subscribers file://aws/json/budget-notifications-with-subscribers.json
```

### Create SNS Topic

- We need an SNS topic before we create an alarm.
- The SNS topic is what will delivery us an alert when we get overbilled
- [aws sns create-topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sns/create-topic.html)

We'll create a SNS Topic
```sh
aws sns create-topic --name billing-alarm
```
which will return a TopicARN

We'll create a subscription supply the TopicARN and our Email
```sh
aws sns subscribe \
    --topic-arn TopicARN \
    --protocol email \
    --notification-endpoint your@email.com
```

Check your email and confirm the subscription

#### Create Alarm

- [aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/put-metric-alarm.html)
- [Create an Alarm via AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudwatch-estimatedcharges-alarm/)
- We need to update the configuration json script with the TopicARN we generated earlier
- We are just a json file because --metrics is is required for expressions and so its easier to us a JSON file.

```sh
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --cli-input-json file://aws/json/alarm_config.json
```
